# AI Prompts Documentation

This document contains the AI prompts and interactions used during the development of the Slack Daily Standup Bot.

The bot was developed using AI assistance (Claude) to accelerate development and was used strategically for:

- Project architecture and structure setup
- Slack SDK implementation guidance
- OpenAI API integration patterns
- TypeScript configuration and best practices
- Error handling and debugging support
- Code optimization and refactoring



## Project Initialization

### Foundation Setup
**Prompt**: "I need to build a Slack bot for daily standups. What's the recommended project structure and initial setup for a TypeScript Node.js application?"
**Prompt**: "What are the essential dependencies I need for a Slack bot that will integrate with OpenAI API for generating reports?"
**Prompt**: "Explain the differences between Slack's Socket Mode and HTTP Webhooks. Which is better for a standup bot?"

### Repository and Version Control
**Prompt**: "What's the purpose of README.md and prompts.md files in a professional project?"
**Prompt**: "Guide me through creating a GitHub repository and establishing a proper commit workflow for this project."



## Core Implementation

### Slack Integration
**Prompt**: "Create a TypeScript Slack bot that posts daily standup questions. Start with a simple implementation that we can iterate on."
**Prompt**: "What are the minimum required Slack bot token scopes for posting messages, reading responses, and sending direct messages?"
**Prompt**: "How do I properly handle Slack events and implement message scheduling in a Node.js environment?"

### Scheduling Implementation
**Prompt**: "Compare different approaches for implementing daily scheduling in Node.js: setTimeout vs cron packages. What are the pros and cons?"
**Prompt**: "What are cost-effective alternatives to OpenAI API for text summarization and analysis tasks?"



## Development Tools and Environment

### Development Setup
**Prompt**: "What development tools and programs do I need to set up for building and testing a Slack bot locally?"
**Prompt**: "Explain how to use ngrok for local Slack app development and testing."



## Debugging and Problem Solving

### Common Issues Resolution
**Prompt**: "How do I debug and resolve OpenAI API quota exceeded errors in a production environment?"
**Prompt**: "How can I test the daily scheduling functionality without waiting 24 hours between tests?"

### Error Handling Strategies
**Prompt**: "Implement comprehensive error handling for Slack API calls, OpenAI API integration, and scheduling failures."



## Code Quality and Documentation

### Documentation Standards
**Prompt**: "Generate JSDoc comments for all public methods and classes following TypeScript best practices."
**Prompt**: "Create a comprehensive README.md that explains installation, configuration, and usage for both developers and end users."

### Code Optimization
**Prompt**: "Review and optimize the bot code for better performance, error resilience, and maintainability."
**Prompt**: "Implement proper TypeScript interfaces and types for all Slack and OpenAI API interactions."
