## Development Prompts Used

### Initial Project Setup
- **Prompt**: "How do I get started with building a Slack bot for daily standups?"
- **AI Tool**: Claude
- **Purpose**: Understanding project requirements and setup steps

### Code Generation Prompts
- **Prompt**: "Create a TypeScript Slack bot using Bolt framework that posts daily standup questions"
- **AI Tool**: Claude  
- **Purpose**: Generate the main bot application code

# AI Prompts Documentation

This document contains all the key prompts and AI interactions used during the development of the Slack Daily Standup Bot.

## Development Process

The bot was developed using AI assistance (Claude) for:
- Project structure setup
- Slack Bot framework implementation  
- OpenAI API integration
- TypeScript configuration
- Error handling and debugging

## Core AI Prompt for Report Generation

### OpenAI Prompt Used in Production

The following prompt is sent to OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to generate intelligent standup reports:

```
You are a team lead assistant. Analyze these daily standup responses and create a concise, actionable report.

Team Responses:
${responsesText}

Please provide:
1. Brief progress summary
2. Today's focus areas
3. Blockers that need attention
4. Any recommendations for the team lead

Keep it professional but friendly, and highlight urgent items.
```

### Prompt Parameters
- **Model**: `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- **Max Tokens**: 500
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)

## Development Prompts Used with Claude

### Initial Project Setup
```
I need to create a Slack bot for daily standups that:
1. Posts questions automatically each day
2. Collects team responses
3. Generates AI reports for team leaders
4. Uses TypeScript and integrates with OpenAI
```

### Code Structure and Implementation
```
Help me implement:
- Slack Bot framework setup using @slack/bolt
- Environment variable configuration
- Message handling for team responses
- OpenAI API integration for intelligent reports
- Daily scheduling system
```

### Error Handling and Debugging
```
The bot is getting [specific error]. How do I:
- Debug OpenAI API quota issues
- Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- Handle Slack API authentication
- Test the scheduling functionality
```

### Architecture and Best Practices
```
What's the best way to structure a Slack bot that:
- Runs continuously in production
- Handles daily scheduling
- Integrates multiple APIs (Slack + OpenAI)
- Manages environment configurations securely
```

## AI Tools and Assistance Used

### Development Tools
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Primary development assistant
  - Code generation and debugging
  - Architecture guidance
  - Documentation creation
  - Problem-solving support

### Specific AI Contributions
1. **Initial bot structure** - Slack Bolt framework setup
2. **OpenAI integration** - API calls and error handling
3. **Scheduling implementation** - Daily automation logic
4. **Environment configuration** - Secure token management
5. **TypeScript setup** - Proper typing and compilation
6. **Documentation** - README and prompts.md creation

## Prompt Engineering Insights

### Effective Strategies Used
- **Specific requirements** - Clearly defined what the bot should do
- **Step-by-step approach** - Breaking complex tasks into smaller parts
- **Context providing** - Sharing error messages and current code state
- **Iterative refinement** - Testing and improving based on results

### Key Learning
- Start with simple solutions (setTimeout vs cron)
- Understand every piece of generated code
- Test incrementally rather than building everything at once
- Document the development process for transparency

## Future Improvements

Potential AI-powered enhancements discussed but not implemented:
- Sentiment analysis of team responses
- Trend detection across multiple days
- Automated blocker escalation
- Team productivity insights
- Integration with project management tools
